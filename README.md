# Storytime App

## Introduction
The Storytime App is a visual storytelling presentation app. The inspiration for this app is Fred Rogers and his children's program, "[Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/)". The app displays difficult concepts and displays them in a whimsical, easy to understand style and format.

Fred Rogers's style was to take complex topics and transform them into gentle, accessible narratives that honored children's intelligence while respecting their emotional development. He would often use simple analogies, visual aids like pictures and models, and personal anecdotes to make abstract concepts concrete. When explaining historical events or difficult subjects, Rogers would focus on the human elements - the feelings, relationships, and universal experiences that children could relate to. He believed in speaking truthfully but age-appropriately, using a calm, unhurried pace that allowed children time to process information. His storytelling approach emphasized reassurance and understanding, often addressing children's fears and curiosities with patience and warmth, making learning feel safe and meaningful rather than overwhelming.

This app will reflect this style, and will incorporate visual elements from "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" in order to present various different topics. This app is a tribute to Fred in order to express my appreciation for all the hours that he gave me when he was talking directly to me as a child, via the medium of television.
