## What is an MVP?

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a development technique where a new product is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The goal is to provide immediate value to users while minimizing development costs and risks. The concept was popularized by Eric Ries in "The Lean Startup" methodology.

### Key Characteristics of an MVP:
- **Minimal**: Contains only the core features necessary to solve the primary problem
- **Viable**: Provides real value to users and can stand alone as a product
- **Product**: Something that users can actually use and provide feedback on

### MVP vs. Other Concepts:
- **Prototype**: Often non-functional, used for concept validation
- **Proof of Concept**: Technical feasibility demonstration
- **Beta Product**: Feature-complete but may have bugs
- **MVP**: Functional product with core features that delivers value

## Why MVPs are Used

### 1. Risk Reduction
- Minimize financial investment before market validation
- Reduce time-to-market risks
- Lower opportunity costs of building wrong features

### 2. Learning & Validation
- Test core hypotheses with real users
- Validate product-market fit early
- Gather authentic user feedback
- Understand user behavior patterns

### 3. Resource Optimization
- Focus development resources on essential features
- Avoid feature bloat and scope creep
- Enable faster iteration cycles
- Reduce development complexity

### 4. Market Entry
- Enter market quickly to gain first-mover advantage

- Establish market presence before competitors

## Supporting Frameworks

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

JTBD helps identify what customers are truly "hiring" your product to do. It focuses on the underlying job or need that drives purchase decisions.

#### Core JTBD Principles:
1. **Functional Job**: The practical task users need to accomplish
2. **Emotional Job**: How users want to feel when using the product
3. **Social Job**: How users want to be perceived by others

#### JTBD in MVP Development:
- **Problem Identification**: Understand the real job customers need done
- **Feature Prioritization**: Focus MVP on core job fulfillment
- **Market Segmentation**: Group users by job similarity, not demographics
- **Success Metrics**: Measure how well the MVP completes the job

#### JTBD Process:
1. **Job Discovery**: Interview customers about their struggles and goals
2. **Job Statement Creation**: "When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"
3. **Outcome Definition**: Define what success looks like for the job
4. **Solution Design**: Build MVP features that best complete the job
