# Version 0.0.5 Specs

## Requirements
1. Use ai versus internet component as our reference for new "stories" to be developed.
2. For each "card" such as .milestone-content[_ngcontent-ng-c3479124041], when a user clicks on the card, it shall be scaled up to fill the screen with larger fonts to fill the viewport in a kiosk style. Each story is intended to be presented to an audience in a large meeting room on a widescreen so the text needs to be readable at a distance. 
3. Apply this styling to all of these cards on the ai versus internet story.
4. Ensure that the kiosk style presentation mode is available to be implemnted in future stories.

## Notes
- Maintain consistency with Fred Rogers' gentle storytelling approach
