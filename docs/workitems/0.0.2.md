# Version 0.0.2 Specs

## Requirements
1. Remove Angular boiler plate text and Sidebar from the hom page.
2. Refactor the clickable "story" elements with a "card" style interface for each story. Each story card shall give a brief description of the content for the page it links to.
3. Each card should be the same size. If the content cannot be displayed in the card, the text should be truncated and show a "..." where the text is truncated.
4. Hovering over the card shall enlarge it, allowing the user to scroll to read all of the summary text.
5. Clicking on any part of the card takes the user to the "story" page.
