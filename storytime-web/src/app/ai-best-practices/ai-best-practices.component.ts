      content: [
        '**What is a Prompt?**\n\nA prompt is simply how you ask your AI friend for help. It\'s like when you ask a neighbor for directions - the clearer you are about where you want to go, the better directions they can give you.',
        '**The Four Keys to Good Prompts:**\n\n1. **Be Clear and Specific**: Instead of "Tell me about dogs," try "Tell me about three dog breeds that are good for families with young children who live in apartments."\n\n2. **Give Context**: Your AI friend doesn\'t know your situation unless you explain it. For example: "I\'m a small business owner with five employees. I need to write an email to my team about our new vacation policy."\n\n3. **Break Big Tasks into Smaller Steps**: If you need help with something complex, don\'t try to do it all at once. Ask for an outline first, then work on each section.\n\n4. **Ask for the Format You Want**: Do you need a list? A story? Bullet points? Tell your AI friend! "Please give me five tips in a numbered list."',
        '**Examples of Effective Prompts:**\n\n‚ùå Not So Clear: "Write something about my product."\n\n‚úì Much Better: "Write a friendly 100-word description of my handmade candles for my small business website. The candles are made with soy wax and essential oils. My customers value natural products and supporting local artisans."\n\n‚ùå Not So Clear: "Help with my meeting."\n\n‚úì Much Better: "I\'m leading a team meeting about our Q3 goals. Help me create a 5-item agenda that includes: reviewing last quarter\'s results, discussing new projects, and team building. The meeting is one hour long."'

    ['custom-instructions', {
      title: 'Custom Instructions: Teaching Your AI About You',
      content: [
        '**What Are Custom Instructions?**\n\nCustom instructions are like introducing yourself to a new friend. You\'re telling the AI about who you are, what you do, and how you like to work. Once you set these up, your AI friend remembers them and uses this information to help you better every time.',
        '**What to Include:**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Your Role**: "I\'m a high school teacher" or "I work in healthcare administration"\n‚Ä¢ **Your Goals**: "I often need help creating lesson plans" or "I frequently write reports for senior leadership"\n‚Ä¢ **Your Preferences**: "I prefer simple language without jargon" or "I like detailed explanations with examples"\n‚Ä¢ **Your Constraints**: "I work with confidential patient information, so never store specific details"',
        '**Example Custom Instructions:**\n\n**For a Teacher**: "I\'m a 9th grade English teacher. I often need help creating engaging lesson plans, writing prompts, and activity ideas. I prefer clear, structured responses with practical examples. My students enjoy interactive activities and real-world connections. Please keep suggestions appropriate for 14-15 year olds."\n\n**For a Business Leader**: "I\'m a department director in a non-profit organization. I frequently need help drafting communications for my team and board members. I value clear, warm, professional language. Please provide concise responses unless I ask for more detail."'

    ['definitions', {
      title: 'Key Definitions: Understanding the Language',
      content: [
        '**Large Language Model (LLM)**\n\nThink of an LLM as a very well-read friend who has studied millions of books, websites, and conversations. They can recognize patterns in language and use those patterns to help you write, think, and create. The "large" part means they\'ve learned from an enormous amount of information.\n\n**Token**\n\nA token is like a building block of language. It might be a word, part of a word, or even just a few letters. When you talk to an AI, it breaks your words into these small pieces to understand them better. Most AI tools have limits on how many tokens you can use in one conversation.',
        '**Prompt**\n\nA prompt is your question or request to the AI. It\'s how you start the conversation and explain what you need help with.\n\n**Context Window**\n\nImagine you\'re having a conversation with a friend, but they can only remember the last hour of what you talked about. That\'s a context window - it\'s how much of your conversation the AI can "remember" and use to help you. Newer AI tools have bigger context windows.',
        '**Training Data**\n\nThis is all the information the AI learned from before it started talking to you. Think of it like everything a person learned in school and from reading books - it\'s their knowledge base.\n\n**Hallucination**\n\nSometimes, AI makes things up - and it does so very confidently! This is called a hallucination. The AI might create facts, quotes, or references that sound real but aren\'t true. That\'s why it\'s important to verify important information.\n\n**Temperature**\n\nThis is like a creativity dial. Lower temperature means the AI is more careful and predictable - good for factual tasks. Higher temperature means the AI is more creative and varied - good for brainstorming.'

        '**For Business Leaders:**\n\n‚Ä¢ **Strategic Planning**: "Help me identify potential risks and opportunities for expanding into the European market."\n‚Ä¢ **Communication**: "Draft talking points for my presentation to the board about our sustainability initiatives."\n‚Ä¢ **Analysis**: "What are the key trends in remote work policies that we should consider?"\n‚Ä¢ **Decision Support**: "Help me create a decision matrix for evaluating these three software vendors."',

When you create something with AI help, remember you\'re responsible for what you publish or share. For important documents, have a human expert review them.',

Always verify:\n‚Ä¢ Facts and statistics\n‚Ä¢ Quotes and citations\n‚Ä¢ Technical specifications\n‚Ä¢ Legal or medical information\n‚Ä¢ Historical dates and events\n\nGood Practice: "Let me double-check that statistic before including it in my report."',

        '**Over-Relying on First Responses**\n\nThe first answer AI gives you isn\'t always the best. It\'s okay to ask follow-up questions, request refinements, or try different approaches. Just like a conversation with a friend, sometimes you need to go back and forth to get to the best answer.\n\n‚ùå Instead of Accepting: "Well, that\'s good enough."\n‚úì Try This: "This is helpful, but can you make it more specific to my situation?" or "Can you give me three different versions to choose from?"',
        '**Forgetting to Add Your Expertise**\n\nYou know things AI doesn\'t know - your industry, your customers, your organization\'s culture. Always add your human expertise to AI outputs.\n\nRemember: AI gives you a starting point. You make it excellent by adding what you know.\n\n**Sharing Too Much Information**\n\nIt\'s easy to forget you\'re typing into a computer. Even with enterprise tools, be thoughtful about what you share. Ask yourself: "Would I be comfortable if others saw this?"',
        '**Not Checking for Accuracy**\n\nAI sounds confident even when it\'s wrong. For anything important, verify the facts. Check the numbers. Look up the references. Your judgment is irreplaceable.\n\n**Expecting Perfection**\n\nAI is a tool, and like all tools, it has limitations. Sometimes it misunderstands. Sometimes it gives odd suggestions. That\'s normal.
